We are a Arch Linux community organization based in Canada. We are NOT the official arch linux organization. We have nothing to do with archlinux-cn. We do not have any profitable projects. We are always operating at a loss.

We are committed to the promotion of the free software movement. At the same time, we help people in countries where the Internet is blocked to break through Internet blocking and censorship.

If you need tools to break through Internet blocking and censorship, please send a blank email to archlinuxstudio@tutamail.com. We will send it for you.

If you have any news that you want to share with us, please use tutamail to send us an encrypted email.

Special thanks to [Tutanota](https://tutanota.com/) for providing email support to us. Fighting for democracy and freedom, we are not alone.
